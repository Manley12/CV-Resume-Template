# CV/Resume Template
This is a template for CVs and Resumes written in HTML using CSS for affects.
Inside the source code, there is instructions on how to modify attributes to suit your needs/wants. If you have any questions or need help, do not hesistate to let me know.

I am also willing to make a whole new template for somebody if they ask, for a small fee (no more than $5 a template, depending on the complexity). 

Finally, I will fill in a CV/Resume for you if you provide me with the neccessary details, again, for a small fee (no more than $15).
